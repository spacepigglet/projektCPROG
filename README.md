# projektCPROG
The objective of this project was to build a game engine.
We made an arcade platform type game where the backgound continually scrolls and the player gets to jump between platforms and avoid or kill enemies by jumping on them.
In our implementaion using the game engine we made a Spacepig that has to look out for aliens!
